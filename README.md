# UCI Capstone Project

This is a UCI Data Science Undergraduate Capstone Project under the Stats 170A/B course. The project group consists of myself and Anjali Krishnan (@anjalik2).

*The project is currently a work in progress.* The aim is to develop a system to examine a possible association between public sentiment as reflected in Reddit news posts and comments, and the popularity of various songs as seen on online music charts. We are hoping that knowledge of current events can provide insight as to the kinds of music that will become of public interest at the same point in time.
