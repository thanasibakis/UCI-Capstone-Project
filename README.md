# UCI Capstone Project

This is a UCI Data Science Undergraduate Capstone Project under the Stats 170A/B course. The project group consists of myself and Anjali Krishnan (@anjalik2).

*The project is currently a work in progress.* The aim is to develop a system to examine a possible association between public sentiment as reflected in Reddit news posts and comments, and the popularity of various songs as seen on online music charts. We are hoping that knowledge of current events can provide insight as to the kinds of music that will become of public interest at the same point in time.

The repository's directory breakdown is as follow:

- *data_tools*, which contains scripts that perform web scraping and feature engineering to create one dataset
- *EDA*, which contains code to visualize aspects of the resulting dataset
- *models*, which contains code to fit various models on the dataset
