How good are the soft predictions?
  
```{r}
predictions %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = soft_prediction, x = response)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lavender") +
  labs(
    x = "Response Value",
    y = "Model Predicted Probability",
    title = "Distribution of model soft predictions",
    subtitle = "by response value"
  ) +
  theme(
    text = element_text(size = 14, family = "Roboto Light"),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 20)
  )
```
